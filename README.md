# python-geoip
Part 1 of an experiment to create batch IP geolocation in python
 
Requirements:
- Python (I'm using 2.7)
- Flask
- Pygeoip

As recommended by Flask, this works well in a virtual environment.

To-Do:

- CSV import (date + time + IP)
- Batch geolocation
- CSV export (date + time + IP + location)
